# 📚 Book Repository

A personal book management application built with **React**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB Atlas**, designed for full-stack web development practice.

Users can search books using the **Google Books API**, save them to their personal bookshelf stored in a **cloud-based MongoDB database**, and browse or delete them later — all through a smooth and responsive UI.
